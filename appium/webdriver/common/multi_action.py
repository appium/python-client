# The Selenium team implemented something like the Multi Action API in the form of
# "action chains" (https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/py/selenium/webdriver/common/action_chains.py).
# These do not quite work for this situation, and do not allow for ad hoc action
# chaining as the spec requires.
