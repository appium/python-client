# The Selenium team implemented a version of the Touch Action API in their code
# (https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/py/selenium/webdriver/common/touch_actions.py)
# but it is deficient in many ways, and does not work in such a way as to be
# amenable to Appium's use of iOS UIAutomation and Android UIAutomator
# So it is reimplemented here.
#
# Theirs is `TouchActions`. Appium's is `TouchAction`.
